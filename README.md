# DataRes S24 Research Coding Assessment

## Due by April 5, 2024 @ 11:59 PM

### To start, head over to [DataRes_Research_Coding_Assessment.ipynb] and download the notebook. Open it in either Google Colab or Kaggle notebook (I prefer Kaggle because the GPUs are faster) and start coding! This assessment will be done using PyTorch, so apologies if you're more familiar with TensorFlow (although the concepts will still carry over). After you're done, send me the file at larrylu0302@g.ucla.edu with the subject "DataRes Research Application S24".

#### Remarks from Research Head

Hey! I'm Larry, and I'll be the research head this year.  This is a quick assessment to just test basic proficiency with deep learning and libraries.

We just want to push this message across extremely heavily: we are not approaching these deep learning projects from the perspective of a data analyst or programmer; *we are approaching these projects with the mindset of a researcher.* Just like any biologist or scientist, we are going to dive deeply into novel literature regarding our field, and take existing technologies and extend them into applications of our liking. Just like a biologist looks at past studies, we will also look at recent studies regarding deep learning, and learn from them.

That is what makes the DataRes Research team different from other data science organizations. We are scientists first, and then programmers.

#### Thanks, Lukas and Sammy
